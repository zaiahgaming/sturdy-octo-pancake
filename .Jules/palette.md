## 2024-03-24 - Focus Indicators on Canvas Menus
**Learning:** In browser games that are heavily keyboard-driven (e.g., using WASD for movement), users often instinctually use the keyboard (like the Tab key) to navigate through HTML overlay menus (Start Screen, Game Over screen). This makes `focus-visible` states critical for accessibility and usability in what might otherwise seem like a mouse-driven UI layer.
**Action:** Always ensure that any HTML UI elements overlaid on a canvas game have clear keyboard focus indicators, even if the primary interaction is intended to be via mouse or touch.
## 2026-07-10 - Avoid direct use of hasOwnProperty
**Learning:** Direct use of `hasOwnProperty` on an object (e.g., `obj.hasOwnProperty(key)`) is a security vulnerability (prototype pollution/override). An attacker could pass a key named "hasOwnProperty" and override the method, causing a crash or unexpected behavior when it's called.
**Action:** Use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)` to safely check for properties.
## 2024-11-06 - [Canvas Focus UX]
**Learning:** Requiring users to click the canvas before keyboard inputs register is poor UX. Adding tabindex and programmatically focusing the canvas on start/restart improves keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** Added tabindex="0" and aria-label to the canvas, and called canvas.focus() in the start and restart button click handlers.
## 2024-11-06 - [Dialog Focus Management]
**Learning:** When displaying modal overlays (like a Game Over screen) over a canvas, keyboard focus is lost or left behind on the canvas. Screen readers and keyboard users require focus to be programmatically moved to the modal's primary action button for accessibility.
**Action:** Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby` to the overlay screens, and implemented `element.focus()` on the restart button when the game ends.
